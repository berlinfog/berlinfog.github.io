### 2.我的

​	During the recent years, huge changes have taken place in the society, which make young people creative and want to be distinctive from others. However, there also exists more rules for them to obey. Someone insists that rules are set to protect young people from temptations and breaking the laws. For my perspective, I suppose it is of great significance for the society to set restriction for young people and regulate their behaviors.

 	First of all, strict rules can keep young people safe and avoid lots of danger in the society nowadays.  <b>To put it in another way</b>, cause they are not mature enough to drink ,they can keep themselves away from becoming alcoholics and do absurd things. So,the limits for age really counts in the society to ensure young people's physical and mental health. <b>Take my own experience for  instance</b>,when I am in the middle school, I traveled to Singapore  with some of my classmates. All of us were teenagers and tried to experience the different cultures. One day afternoon after leaving our guide we decided to go to the casino to try some adventures. However ,upon our arriving the gate of the casino, we were not allowed to get in due to the age limits. We were all disappointed a lot and cannot understand why. After coming back, my parents told me many adults cannot control themselves and even lose not only all their money but their family ,not alone adolescent like us . I felt lucky that the age limit protect our team because young people like us are immature and not self-controlled. If the casino allowed young people like us to come in, more people may be in debt and even commit suicide, leading unhealthy development for their growth.

​	Also,strict rules can help young people grow into a qualified adult with good education and correct values, so they can continue to contribute to the society and make society more harmonious. In the <b>Middle ages </b>,there are no rules that everyone must receive education,most of the people have no way but to do labor work. But nowadays, most of jobs require technology and knowledge to finish the complicated work. Under such circumstances, the compulsory education become a must for young people to get basic cognition and inspire them to explore the scientific world after graduating.

​	In a conclusion,only the societies build up strict rules for young people can not only the society get harmony, but also help young people gain a wonderful life. This is because it can keep them safe and teach them moral values.

On the contemporary society, there are more and more rules that restricting young people in life. When it now comes to the issue of societies put strict rule for young people to obey, people\'s opinions differ from person to person. Someone believes that societies expect more for the young and set strict rules for them; while others imply that young people need to follow the rules to keep society being harmonious. However, in the ultimate analysis, I contend that young people need to obey strict rules and it is significant for society to set this restriction for them. 
First of all, strict rules that societies introduce for young people can keep them safe. To put it another way, the strict rules, such as limited age for surfing, club, enable young people to keep away from danger that they may do not have ability to avoid by themselves. Thus, it is significant for societies to set those rules in order to help them to be safe. Take my own experience for instance, when I was in high school, I was merely 18 years old, and I traveled with my parents to Hong Kong. There was a casino which was famous in there and I really wanted to go because I had learnt about a lot of math formulas and financial analysis that were original from casino, yet when I been there, I was not allowed to getting in because I was inferior to 21 years old. So I was just waiting outside for my parents and felt pity. However, my parents came out quickly and told me that there were many people inside not only lost much money, but also put more in for winning back. So, I realized that people under 21 not just did not have much money for winning one round, but did not have self-controlled. However, if the casino did not set such rules, there will be more young people suicide and get depression because they could not pay the debt.
Aside from the foregoing point, the strict rules allow young people to follow moral values. It is not hard to be proved because young people, who do not accept education, will easily become criminals and even murder people. Therefore, societies teach them to be honest via this way. Take my neighborhood for example, he is 40 years old now and do not accept any education. At first, when he was 20 years old, he was stealing for surviving because he did not have even one skill for making a living and did not know about the concept of honesty. After that, when he succeeded, he began to break into others house and robbed money. However, once he was going to murder people, yet noticed by polices and put into prison, that was the result of not accepting education and he did not know how to self-discipline. On the contrary, today, people are requires to accept compulsory education and school will teach them moral values and skills. Had it not been for the rules that they need to learn the right things, how could the crime level of the society reduce?
In conclusion, from what has been discussed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that only the societies build up strict rules for young people can not only the society get harmony, but also help young people gain a wonderful life. This is because it can keep them safe and teach them moral values.
